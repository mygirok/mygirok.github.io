# Basic Scheduling algorithms

## FCFS(First-Come-First-Service)
- Non-preemptive scheduling
- Scheduling criteria
    - ready queue
- High resource utilization
    - Low scheduling overhead
- Good for Batch system, Not good for interactive system
- Weakness
    - Convoy effect
    - long response time

## RR(Round-Robin)
- Preemptive scheduling
- Scheduling criteria
    - ready queue
- Time quantum
    - System parameter
    - Timer-runout
    - Anti-monopoly
    - High context switch overhead
- Good for interactive system

## SPN (Shortest-Process-Next)
- Non-preemptive scheduling
- Scheduling criteria
    - burst time
        - SJF(Shortest Job First) scheduling

## SRTN(Shortest Remaining Time Next)
- Preemptive scheduling
- Context switching overhead

## HRRN(High-REsponse-Ratio-Next)
- SPN + Aging concepts, Non-preemptive scheduling
- Aging concepts
- Scheduing criteria
    - Response ratio = (WT + BT) / BT

## MLQ(Multi-level Queue)
- Have a ready queue for each Job (or Priority)
    - Can't get out of assigned queue
- Weakness
    - overhead
    - Low priority queue starvation

## MFQ(Multi-level Feedback Queue)
- Allow process to move between Queue
- Dynamic priority
- Preemptive scheduling
- Favor short burst-time processes
- Favor I/O bounded processes
- Improve adaptability
