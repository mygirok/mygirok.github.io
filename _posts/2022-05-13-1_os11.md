## Virtual memory
- Non-continuous allocation
- Paging/Segmentation system

## Cost Model for Virtual Mem. Sys.
- Page fault frequency
- Page fault rate

## Hardware Components
- Address translation device
    - TLB(associated memories), Dedicated page-table register, Cache memories
- Bit Vectors
    - Reference bits(used bit)
    - Update bits(modified bits, write bits, dirty bits)

## Software Components
- Allocation strategies
- Fetch strategies
- Placement strategies
- Replacement strategies
- Cleaning strategies
- Load control strategies

### Replacement Strategies
- Fixed allocation
    - MIN(OPT, B0) algorithm
    - Random algorithm
    - FIFO(First In First Out) algorithm
    - LRU(Least Recently Used) algorithm
    - LFU(Least Frequently Used) algorithm
    - NUR(Not Used Recently) algorithm
    - Clock algorithm
    - Second chance algorithm
- Variable allocation
    - WS(Working Set) algorithm
    - PFF(Page Fault Frequency) algorithm
    - VMIN(Variable MIN) algorithm

## Other Considerations
- Page size
- Program restructuring
- TLB reach
