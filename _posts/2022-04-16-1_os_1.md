## Computer Hardware
- [Processor](#processor)
    - CPU
    - GPU
- [Memory](#memory)
    - RAM, ROM
    - HDD, SSD
- [I/O Device](#io-device)
    - Keyboard, Mouse
    - Monitor, Printer

# Processor
Central Processing Unit(CPU)
- Processing unit
- Control unit

## Register
- Memory inside the processor
  - Store the data that the processor will use
  - Fastest memory on your computer

- User-visible register
  - DR, Data Register
  - AR, Address Register

- User-invisible register
  - PC, Program Counter
  - IR, Instruction Register
  - ACC, ACCumulator
  - MAR, Memory Address Register
  - MBR, Memory Buffer Register

## Operating Systems and Processor
- Assigning and managing tasks to process to the processor
  - Process creation and management
- Control the program's processor
  - Manage processor usage times for programs

# Memory
- Memory Type
  - [Register](#register)
  - [Cache](#cache)
  - [Main memory](#main-memory)
  - Disk

## Main memory
- Store programs and data that the processor will perform
- Primarily use DRAM
  - Large capacity, low price
- Reduce disk I/O botleneck

## Cache
- Memory inside the processor(L1, L2 cache etc) 
  - Fast, expensive
- Reduce main memory I/O botleneck

## Cache works
- Cache hit
- Cache miss

## Locality
- Spatial locality
- Temporal locality

## Operating Systems and Memory
- Memory Allocation and Management
- Virtual Memory Management

# System Bus

- The physical path through which hardware sends and receives data and signals
  - Data bus
  - Address bus
  - Control bus

# I/O Device
## Operating Systems and I/O Device
- Managing device drivers
- Interrupt Handling
- File and disk management
