## Deadlock
- Blocked / Asleep state
- Deadlock state 
- Deadlock vs Starvation

### Classification by preemptive availability
- Preemptible resources
    - Processor, memory
- Non-preemptible resources
    - disk drive

### Classification by allocation unit
- Total allocation resources
    - Processor, disk drive
- Partitioned allocation resources
    - Moemory

### Classification based on concurrent use
- Exclusive allocation resources
    - Processor, memory, disk drive
- Shared allocation resource
    - Program(sw), shared data

### Classification based on reusability
- SR(Serially-reusable Resources)
    - Processor, memory, disk drive, program
- CR (Consumable Resources)
    - signal, message

### Deadlock Model
- Graph Model
- State Transition Model

#### Graph Model
- Node
- Edge

#### State Transition Model
- State

### Deadlock Occurrence Conditions
- Exclusive use of resources
- Non-preemptible resources
- Hold and wait (Partial allocation)
- Circular wait

### Deadlock solution
- Deadlock prevention methods
- Deadlock avoidance method
- Deadlock detection and deadlock recovery methods

#### Deadlock Prevention
- Remove one of the four deadlock occurrence requirements
    - Exclusive use of resources
    - Non-preemptible resources
    - Hold and wait (Partial allocation)
    - Circular wait
- Low device utilization
- Reduced system throughput
- Not practical

#### Deadlock Avoidance
- Safe state
    - Safe sequence exists
- Unsafe state
- High overhead
- Low resource utilization
- Not practical

### Deadlock Detection
- Resource Allocation Graph(RAG)
    - Directed, bipartite Graph

#### Deadlock Detection Method
- Graph reduction
    - Completely reduced
    - Irreducible

### Deadlock Recovery
- deadlock recovery methods
    - Process termination
    - Resource preemption

#### Process termination
- Termination cost model
    - Termination cost
        - Precess priority
        - Process type
        - Accumulated execution time of the process
        - Remaining time of the process
        - Accounting cost
        - Etc.

#### Resource preemption
- Preemption cost model
- Minimum cost recovery method
    - O(r)
