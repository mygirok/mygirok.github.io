# Process
## Job vs Process
- Job / Program
    - Programs + Data to run
    - Status before the execution request to the computer system

- Process
    - Jobs registered on the system for execution

## Resource
- Passive entity
- H/W resources
    - Processor, memory, disk, monitor, keyboard, Etc.
- S/W resources
    - Message, signal, files, installed SWs, Etc.
- Process
    - Jobs registered on the system for execution

## Process Control Block (PCB)
- OS stores information needed to manage processes
- Create at process creation

## Process States
### Created State
- Ready or Suspended ready

### Ready State
- Waiting for processor assignment
- Dispatch(or Schedule)
    - Ready state -> running state

### Running State
- Allocated processors and all the resources
- Preemption
    - Running state -> ready states
- Block / sleep
    - Running state -> asleep state

### Blocked / Asleep State
- Wake-up
    - Asleep state -> ready state

### Suspended State
- Memory not allocated (stolen) state
- Swap-out(suspended), Swap-in(resume)

### Terminated / Zombie State
- Process execution completed
- After returning all resources,
- Only some PCB information remains in the kernel

## Interrupt
- Unexpected, external events
- Types of Interrupts
    - I/O interrupt
    - Clock interrupt
    - Console interrupt
    - Program check interrupt
    - Machine check interrupt
    - Inter-process interrupt
    - System call interrupt

## Context Switching
- Context
    - CPU register context => in CPU
    - Code & data, Stack, PCB => memory
- Context saving
    - Save register context for the current process
- Context restoring
    - Restore register context to process
- Context switching
    - Context saving + Context restoring
