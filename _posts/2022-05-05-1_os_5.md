# Process Scheduling
## Multi-programming
- Multiple processes exist in the system
- Select a process to allocate resources
    - Scheduling
- Resource Management
    - time sharing
        - Process scheduling
    - space sharing
        - memory

## Purpose of Scheduling
- Improves system performance
- System Performance index
    - response time
    - throughput
    - resource utilization

## Scheduling Criteria
- I/O-bounded or compute-bounded
- Batch system or interactive system
- process urgency
- process priority
- process total service time

### CPU burst vs I/O burst
- Performing the Process
    - Use CPU + I/O
- compute-bounded
    - CPU burst > I/O burst
- I/O-bunded
    - I/O burst > CPU burst

## Scheduling Level
- Long-term scheduling
    - Job scheduling
- Mid-term scheduling
    - Memory allocation
- Short-term scheduling
    - Process scheduling

### Long-term Scheduling
- Job scheduling
- Multiprogramming degree control
    - Controlling the number of processes in the system

### Mid-term Scheduling
- Memory allocation
    - Intermediate-level scheduling
    - Swapping(swap-in/swap-out)

### Short-term Scheduling
- Process scheduling
    - Low-level scheduling
    - Determine the process by which to allocate processors
- Most frequent occurrence

## Scheduling policy
- Preemptive scheduling, Non-preemptive scheduling
- Priority

### Non-preemptive scheduling
- system call, I/O, Etc.
- Low context switch overhead 
- Frequent priority reversals, increased average response time

### Preemptive scheduling
- High context switch overhead
- Time-sharing system, real-time system

### Priority
- Staic priority
- Dynamic priority
