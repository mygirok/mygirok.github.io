## I/O Mechanisms
- Processor controlled memory access
    - Polling (Programmed I/O)
    - Interrupt
- Direct Memory Access (DMA)

### Pooling(Programmed I/O)
- The processor periodically checks the status of the I/O devices
    - Simple
    - Pooling overhead

### Interrupt
- After I/O devices completes the task, communicate its status to the processor
    - lower overhead than pooling
    - Interrupt handling overhead

## I/O Servies of OS
- I/O Scheduling
    - E.g., Disk I/O scheduling
- Error handling
    - E.g., disk access fail, network communication error
- I/O device information managements
- Buffering
- Caching
- Spooling

## Disk Scheduling
- Optimizing seek time
    - FCFS (First Come First SErvice)
    - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
    - Scan
    - C-Scan (Circular Scan)
    - Look
- Optimizing rotational delay
    - Sector queueing (SLTF, Shortest Latency Time First)
- SPTF (Shortest Positioning Time First)

### FCFS
- Advantage
    - Simple
        - Low scheduling overhead
- Problem
    - Does not consider optimization

### SSTF
- Advantage
    - High throughput
    - Low average response time
- Problem
    - Low predictability
    - Starvation

### Scan Scheduling
- Advantage
    - Fix starvation issue in SSTF
    - Excellent throughput and average response time
- Problem
    - High response time on the other side of the process

### C-Scan Scheduling
- Similar to Scan Scheduling
- Advantage
    - Equal opportunity than Scan

### Look Scheduling
- Elevator algorithm
- Advantage 
    - Remove unnecessary head movement of Scan

### SLTF
- Use Fixde head disk system
    - E.g., drum disk
- Sector queuing algorithm

### SPTF
- Positioning time = Seek time + rotational delay
- Advantage
    - High throughput
    - Low average response time
- Problem
    - Starvation occurs for innermost and outer cylinder requests

## RAID Architecture
- Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks(RAID)
    - OS support, RAID controller
- Use to improve disk system performance
    - Performance (access speed)
    - Reliability
